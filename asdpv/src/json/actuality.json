The 2023 festival runs from 8 – 19 November; 12 days of events where audiences and film professionals will immerse themselves in a diverse programme of the latest documentary films, interactive projects, exhibitions, performances, post-screening talks and workshops. For the 36th edition of IDFA, Mama Cash is facilitating a screening of the critically acclaimed documentary: “Our Land, Our Freedom” by film makers Meena Nanji & Zippy Kimundu. This film captures issues and topics that Mama Cash is working on, such as land and decolonial justice, human rights and self-led feminist activism. A painful yet hopeful story where two narratives are tied together to show how structural change requires structural fight.   "
